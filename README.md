# Plant-pathology
Deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network, Python, Transfer Learning, Multiclass clasification of plant pathology
### Main goal
The aim of the project is multi-class classification and architecture review and analysis, custom model comparison and transfer learning. A simple convolutional neural network containing 4 convolutional layers was created. Resnet, Xception and VGG19 architectures were used in transfer learning. Then, the classification results were compared and hyperparameter tuning was performed for the best network. The obtained dataset consisted of csv files (test.csv, train.csv, sample_submission.csv) and a folder called 'images' which contained pictures in jpg format signed Train[].jpg and Test[].jpg. The size of each photo is 2048x1365. The images show pictures of healthy leaves and those with various diseases. These diseases may appear as small brown or orange spots. Therefore, our goal is to build a classifier which, based on the received photos, will be able to classify whether the plant is healthy or whether it has pathologies and what type.
